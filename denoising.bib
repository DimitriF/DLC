abstract = {Sophisticated statistical tools are required to extract the full analytical power from high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Especially, the combination of HPTLC fingerprints (image) with chemometrics is rarely used so far. Also, the newly developed, instantaneous direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) method is perspective for sample characterization and differentiation by multivariate data analysis. This is a first novel study on the differentiation of natural products using a combination of fast fingerprint techniques, like HPTLC and DART-MS, for multivariate data analysis. The results obtained by the chemometric evaluation of HPTLC and DART-MS data provided complementary information. The complexity, expense, and analysis time were significantly reduced due to the use of statistical tools for evaluation of fingerprints. The approach allowed categorizing 91 propolis samples from Germany and other locations based on their phenolic compound profile. A high level of confidence was obtained when combining orthogonal approaches (HPTLC and DART-MS) for ultrafast sample characterization. HPTLC with selective post-chromatographic derivatization provided information on polarity, functional groups and spectral properties of marker compounds, while information on possible elemental formulae of principal components (phenolic markers) was obtained by DART-MS. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Puerariae Lobatae Radix (PLR), the root of Pueraria lobata, is a traditional Chinese medicine for treating diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Puerariae Thomsonii Radix (PTR), the root of Pueraria thomsonii, is a closely related species to PLR and has been used as a PLR substitute in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to compare the classification accuracy of high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) with that of ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in differentiating PLR from PTR. The Matlab functions were used to facilitate the digitalisation and pre-processing of the HPTLC plates. Seven multivariate classification methods were evaluated for the two chromatographic methods. The results demonstrated that the HPTLC classification models were comparable to the UPLC classification models. In particular, k-nearest neighbours, partial least square-discriminant analysis, principal component analysis-discriminant analysis and support vector machine-discriminant analysis showed the highest rate of correct species classification, whilst the lowest classification rate was obtained from soft independent modelling of class analogy. In conclusion, HPTLC combined with multivariate analysis is a promising technique for the quality control and differentiation of PLR and PTR. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Calendula officinalis, commonly known Marigold, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of an artificial neural network (ANN) to analyse thin layer chromatography (TLC) chromatograms as fingerprint patterns for quantitative estimation of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and rutin in Calendula plant extracts.By applying samples with different weight ratios of marker compounds to the system, a database of chromatograms was constructed. A hundred and one signal intensities in each of the HPTLC chromatograms were correlated to the amounts of applied chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and rutin using an ANN.The developed ANN correlation was used to quantify the amounts of 3 marker compounds in calendula plant extracts. The minimum quantifiable level (MQL) of 610, 190 and 940. ng and the limit of detection (LD) of 183, 57 and 282. ng were established for chlorogenic, caffeic acid and rutin, respectively.A novel method for quality control of herbal products, based on HPTLC separation, high resolution digital plate imaging and ANN data analysis has been developed. The proposed method can be adopted for routine evaluation of the phytochemical variability in calendula extracts. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The best currently available denoising methods approximate this mapping with cleverly engineered algorithms.

While this has been done before, we will show that by training on large image databases we are able to compete with the current state-of-the-art image denoising methods. Furthermore, our approach is easily adapted to less extensively studied types of noise (by merely exchanging the training data), for which we achieve excellent results as well.},

The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations.},

Some other species such as the roots of B. falcatum, B.bicaule and B. marginatum var. stenophyllum similar to Chaihu can also be occasionally found in local raw herb markets. The quality of 33 lots of authenticated Chaihu samples vs. 31 lots of commercial samples was evaluated by both high-performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD) and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) analyses of its principal bioactive components (saikosaponins). The pre-treated data acquired from both HPLC fingerprints and HPTLC fluorescent images were processed by chemometrics for similarity and pattern recognition, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and an expert's panel. It was apparent that k-NN classifier exhibited good performance with sufficient flexibility for processing HPTLC fingerprint images which were otherwise not easily dealt with by other algorithms due to the shift of R(f) values and varying hue/saturation of the band colours between different TLC plates. These two chromatographic fingerprint methods can be considered complementary measure of quality control. The roots of Chaihu from different species of the genus Bupleurum could readily be distinguished from each other so that commercial samples can easily be classified. Chaihu collected from several major herbal distribution centers was found to belong to B. chinense with great variation in the content of its major saikosaponins.},

abstract = {The digital processing of chromatographic thin-layer plate images has increasing popularity among last years. When using a camera instead of flatbed scanner, the charged coupled device (CCD) noise is a well-known problem-especially when scanning dark plates with weakly fluorescing spots. Various techniques are proposed to denoise (smooth) univariate signals in chemometric processing, but the choice could be difficult. In the current paper the classical filters (Savitzky-Golay, adaptive degree polynomial filter, Fourier denoising, Butterworth and Chebyshev infinite impulse response filters) were compared with the wavelet shrinkage (31 mother wavelets, 3 thresholding techniques and 8 decomposition levels). The signal obtained from 256 averaged videoscans was treated as the reference signal (with noise naturally suppressed, which was found to be almost white one). The best choice for denoising was the Haar mother wavelet with soft denoising and any decomposition level larger than 1. Satisfying similarity to reference signal was also observed in the case of Butterworth filter, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, ADPF filter, Fourier denoising and soft-thresholded wavelet shrinkage with any mother wavelet and middle to high decomposition level. The Chebyshev filters, Whittaker smoother and wavelet shrinkage with hard thresholding were found to be less efficient. The results obtained can be used as general recommendations for univariate denoising of such signals. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We describe a novel unsupervised method for learning sparse, overcomplete fea- tures. The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a spar- sifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vec- tor. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the en- coder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and de- coder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces “stroke detectors” when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like filters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the first layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical filter maps.},

abstract = {Complexity theory of circuits strongly suggests that deep architectures can be much more efficient (sometimes exponentially) than shallow architectures, in terms of computational elements required to represent some functions. Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization.},

Using com-plementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algo-rithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two lay-ers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights us-ing a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algo-rithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit im-ages and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discrimi-native learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modelled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory and it is easy to ex-plore these ravines by using the directed connec-tions to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Jamshidi-Aidji2015,
abstract = {Working in the field of profiling and identification of bioactive compounds in herbal extracts is faced with the challenge that common chromatographic methods do not directly link to bioactive compounds. Direct bioautography, the combination of TLC/HPTLC with bioassays, linked to structure elucidating techniques is demonstrated to overcome this challenge. The combination of TLC and Bacillus subtilis bioassay was already demonstrated to detect the antibiotics in samples. However, previous studies in this field were faced with some challenges, like being time-consuming, leading not to a homogenous plate background or being restricted to a non-acidic mobile phase. In this study, these aspects were investigated and a streamlined HPTLC-. B. subtilis bioassay was developed that generated a homogenous plate background, which was crucial to yield a good baseline for biodensitometry. Two commonly used broths for B. subtilis and a self-designed medium were compared with regard to their capability of detection and baseline noise. The workflow developed allowed the use of acidic mobile phases for the first time. To prove this, 20 herbal extracts were screened for antimicrobial substances developed in parallel with an acidic mobile phase. The main antimicrobial substance in Salvia officinalis tincture detected was further characterized by microchemical reactions, Aliivibrio fischeri, ??-glucosidase and acetylcholinesterase (bio)assays as well as mass spectrometry. Scientists looking for new herbal-based medicine may benefit from this time-saving and streamlined bioactivity profiling.},
